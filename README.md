Executive Summary
-----------------

Spatial statistical modeling and prediction for data on stream networks, including models based on in-stream distance.  Models are created using moving average constructions. Spatial linear models, including explanatory variables, can be fit with (restricted) maximum likelihood.  Mapping and other graphical functions are included.

Installation
------------
